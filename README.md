# MemoryPuzzle
A puzzle that you will have to memorize the order of the 10 numbers. My try is to do this on two different languages, Python, suggested by a friend, and JavaScript, with web development. In this project, will be displayed to you a sequence of numbers, and you will have to memorize them and, after a break, tell the program where was every number.
